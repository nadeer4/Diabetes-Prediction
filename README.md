# Diabetes Prediction
In this project, I explored the "Diabetes Data" imported from Kaggle to answer the following research question: 

**Can we accurately predict diabetes in individuals using data derived the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases?**

I approached this research question in 3 steps: 

1. Exploring and Refining the Dataset
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Machine Learning

In these three steps, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to understand key factors affecting diabetes. Finally, I implemented machine learning models, including logistic regression and support vector classifier and evaluated their performance.
